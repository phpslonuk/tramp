1) create valid html code from design.jpg

2) use ajax request to get data from db.json file

3) use native js to build page from data (ES6 preferable)

4) responsive design
5) build scalable architecture

6) upload your project to public github account

will be a plus:
  - promises for ajax request
  - sass or less for css code
  - some project build tool
